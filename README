MultiPass
=========

Bare bones implementation of encoding and decoding MultiPass values for SSO.

MultiPasses are json hashes encrypted with strong AES encryption.  They are typically
passed as cookie values, URL params, or HTTP header values, depending on how
the individual service chooses to implement it.  

The idea is that if a site wants to automatically create a local user based
on the login credentials of another site, it will look for a MultiPass.  This 
MultiPass can contain the user's email address, name, etc.
